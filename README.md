# roll-the-dice-game
This game first starts off with player 1 clicking the "roll dice" button, which increases the current score. Player 1 is allowed to click on this button as many times as they wish. However, if the dice rolls a 1, the current score will turn to 0 and player 2 begins their turn to roll the dice. The players can choose to hold their current score by clicking the "HOLD" button and add it to the top score which will be zero at the start of the game. If either player scores atleast a 100, the game will end and show the winner. The user can restart the game once the game is over by clicking "NEW GAME" button.
